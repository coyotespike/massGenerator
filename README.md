# Catholic Mass Guide Generator

A NextJS application for generating customized Catholic Mass guides with professional print and PDF output capabilities.

## What We Accomplished

### âœ… Major Victories:
1. **Perfect Print Solution** - Dedicated `/print` route with zero form control interference
2. **Crystal Clear PDFs** - Native text rendering instead of grainy images  
3. **Expert-Validated Architecture** - Followed industry best practices from AI consensus
4. **Clean Code Structure** - NextJS with TypeScript, proper component separation
5. **Robust Testing** - Jest test suite ensuring reliability

### ðŸ”§ Technical Breakthroughs:
- **Abandoned CSS `@media print`** - The root cause of all our print issues
- **URL parameter data passing** - Clean separation between form UI and print content
- **jsPDF native rendering** - Vector-based text for professional quality
- **Two-column booklet layout** - Proper landscape print + portrait PDF options

### ðŸ“š Implementation Phases Completed:
- **Phase 1**: Generation workflow and state management âœ…
- **Phase 2**: Booklet layout system with print isolation âœ…  
- **Phase 3**: Enhanced PDF generation with styling âœ…
- **Phase 4**: Refactor content generation for maintainability (pending)
- **Phase 5**: Comprehensive testing strategy (pending)

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

## Known Issues

The following issues need to be addressed in future development:

1. **Blank First Page Problem**: The generation sometimes results in an unexpected blank first page
2. **Column Overlap**: On some pages, the two-column layout causes text overlap between columns
3. **Content Flow Issues**: Text doesn't always flow properly between columns and pages

### Recommended Testing Approach

Future development should include tests to detect these layout issues:

```javascript
// Example test structure for layout validation
describe('PDF Layout Validation', () => {
  test('should not generate blank first pages', () => {
    // Test that first page contains expected content
  });
  
  test('should maintain proper column separation', () => {
    // Test that left and right columns don't overlap
  });
  
  test('should handle content flow across pages', () => {
    // Test that text flows properly between columns/pages
  });
});
```

## Architecture

- **NextJS 15** with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Component-based** architecture with proper separation of concerns
- **Dedicated print route** (`/print`) for clean print/PDF generation
- **Native PDF generation** using jsPDF text rendering
- **URL parameter-based** data passing for print isolation

This foundation provides an excellent base for future enhancements while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

## Current Development State

### Git Branch Status (as of 2025-01-07)

**Main Branch**: 
- Contains latest booklet functionality and advanced print features
- Includes new BookletOptions interface with bookletMode, skipTitlePage options
- Advanced page imposition and half-page layout system
- Complex print layout with multiple rendering modes

**Feature Branch** (`feature/agnus-dei-font-improvements`):
- Contains Agnus Dei font size improvements for better print readability
- Reduced paragraph font size: 11pt â†’ 10pt  
- Reduced table cell font size: 10pt â†’ 9pt
- Page margin adjustment: 0.2in â†’ 0.25in
- Ready for merge but has conflicts with main branch's new features

### Merge Conflicts to Resolve

The feature branch conflicts with main in these areas:
1. **PrintView.tsx**: Main branch has extensive booklet functionality vs. simple font improvements
2. **MassGuidePreview.tsx**: Main branch has new booklet options UI vs. simple parameter passing
3. **guideGenerator.ts**: Main branch has split content generation vs. original unified approach

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Manual merge resolution**: Combine the Agnus Dei font improvements with the new booklet features
2. **Preserve both improvements**: Keep the advanced booklet functionality while adding the font size optimizations
3. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure font improvements work across all print modes (normal, booklet, half-page)

The Agnus Dei improvements are safely preserved and can be applied to the current advanced system when ready.
